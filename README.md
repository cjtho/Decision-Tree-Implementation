# Decision Tree Classifier Project

## Project Goal
The objective of this project is to develop a Decision Tree classifier from the ground up. This involves delving into the details of the Decision Tree algorithm and applying it to a practical dataset.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project consists of credit card transaction records and is sourced from Kaggle ([Credit Card Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitudageri/credit-card-details)).

## Code Structure
- `DecisionTreePerformanceAnalysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook documenting the development, tuning, and performance evaluation of the Decision Tree classifier.
- `decision_tree.py`: The Python script containing the implementation of the Decision Tree classifier.
- `decision_tree_evaluator.py`: An auxiliary script used for assessing the performance of different model configurations.
- `node.py`: A utility script to define the structure and functionality of nodes in the decision tree.
- `Credit_card_dataset.csv`: The curated dataset file utilised in this project.

## Usage
Start with `DecisionTreePerformanceAnalysis.ipynb` to follow the project workflow. Ensure that the `Credit_card_dataset.csv` is located in the working directory and that necessary Python packages are installed. The additional scripts `decision_tree_evaluator.py` and `node.py` are integrated within the notebook to assist in various operations.

## Future Work
Implement additional splitting criterions.
